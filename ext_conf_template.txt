# cat=basic; type=options[Do not call pageUnavailable=0, Always call pageUnavailable=1, Call pageUnavailable only when not in development context=2]; label=pageUnavailable on exception: What to do when an exception occurs within a controller. If pageUnavailable is not called the default behavior is to display the exception message if not in development context, or trying to display a stack trace if in development context. The stack trace code will be highlighted if EXT:geshilib is installed. If EXT:cc_debug is installed, the stack trace will be displayed in cc_debug's error window, if not it will be displayed in an own popup window. Make sure to have the pageUnavailable handling configured properly in the install tool, if you use it.
