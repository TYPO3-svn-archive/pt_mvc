ToDo: As of 26.10.2009
====
+ Support cached controllers
  
0.0.3dev:
--------
+ (fb) CHG: I extracted generic view features to tx_ptmvc_viewAbstract and copied smarty specific methods to a new extending class tx_ptmvc_viewSmarty.
			The former tx_ptmvc_view extends tx_ptmvc_viewSmarty for backwards compatibility reasons but writes messages into the depreaction log.
			Please Adapt your view to extend tx_ptmvc_viewSmarty if you use smarty views.
			I'm planning to add some fluid views in the near future.
+ (fb) CHG: Changed the behavior of the exception handling in the tx_ptmvc_controller class. Before the exception message was given back as
            controller output in any case and the outputException() method (which can be overriden of course) decided what to do additionally while not
            returning anything. Now the return of the outputException() method is used as controller output. I changed the outputException method to return the
            exception message by default. That means that if you did not override the outputException() method nothing will change for you. Now you have the
            possibility to influence what is displayed as controller output when an exception occurs by overriding the outputException() method. Have fun!
            (This should go into the manual some time... :)
+ (fb) RFT: minor refactoring
+ (fb) ADD: replaced deprecated GParrayMerged by _GPmerged
+ (fb) ADD: tx_ptmvc_controllerFrontend->languageUid will be populated with the current language uid
+ (fb) ADD: using the pageRendererObject if in TYPO3 4.3
       ADD: improvements in kickstarter sections
+ (fb) FIX: generated typoscript templates (ts.php) had php syntax errors
+ (fb) ADD: using t3lib_div::_GPmerged instead of t3lib_div::GParrayMerged() (deprecated) if TYPO3 >= 4.3
+ (fb) ADD: Kickstarter support for creating
       + controller classes
       + view classes
       + typoscript configuration files
       + smarty templates
       CHG: Updated the manual describing the new kickstarter features.
       ADD: added suggest in ext_emconf to use the kickstarter and the tcaobjects extensions 

v0.0.2:  [used for online project 26.10.09]
------
+ (fb) ADD: added storagePid feature for tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository and some minor other changes
+ (fb) CHG: tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository is not abstract anymore and can be used directly as a generec repository
+ (fb) ADD: added generic (and very basic/simple) classes for the "M" in MVC. (DDD-approach instead of active record appreach. That means: No accessors, but repositories!)
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObject.php
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObjectCollection.php
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository.php
+ (fb) ADD: made actionMethodExists() return "notfound" instead of 0 if a action method could not be found.
	   0 resulted in errors during a later switch statement that resulted in returning an empty content
	   when calling an illegal action instead of throw an exception.
+ (fb) ADD: added "prefixId_alternative" configuration parameter that defines an alternative namespace.
  This feature is useful if you want to share a namespace across multiple controllers.
  E.g. if you want a form to be processed by many controllers.
  E.g. if you want multiple pt_list lists to react on a single filter (e.g. string search)
+ (rk) CHG: added default XSS prevention to MVC views ***** IMPORTANT: this may result in unwanted effects for existing code, check and adapt your implemented calls of tx_ptmvc_view::addItem()! *****
  + tx_ptmvc_view::addItem(): added new optional param $filterHtml with default TRUE(!) and appropriate HTML filtering functionality
  + ext_emconf.php: raised pt_tools dependency to version "0.4.2-", raised pt_mvc version to "0.0.2dev"
+ (rk) ADD: DevDoc.txt: added this file
