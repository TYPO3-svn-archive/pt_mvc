ToDo: As of 26.10.2009
====
+ Support cached controllers
  
0.0.3dev:
--------
+ (fb) ADD: using t3lib_div::_GPmerged instead of t3lib_div::GParrayMerged() (deprecated) if TYPO3 >= 4.3
+ (fb) ADD: Kickstarter support for creating
       + controller classes
       + view classes
       + typoscript configuration files
       + smarty templates
       CHG: Updated the manual describing the new kickstarter features.
       ADD: added suggest in ext_emconf to use the kickstarter and the tcaobjects extensions 

v0.0.2:  [used for online project 26.10.09]
------
+ (fb) ADD: added storagePid feature for tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository and some minor other changes
+ (fb) CHG: tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository is not abstract anymore and can be used directly as a generec repository
+ (fb) ADD: added generic (and very basic/simple) classes for the "M" in MVC. (DDD-approach instead of active record appreach. That means: No accessors, but repositories!)
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObject.php
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObjectCollection.php
       + class.tx_ptmvc_dbObjectRepository.php
+ (fb) ADD: made actionMethodExists() return "notfound" instead of 0 if a action method could not be found.
	   0 resulted in errors during a later switch statement that resulted in returning an empty content
	   when calling an illegal action instead of throw an exception.
+ (fb) ADD: added "prefixId_alternative" configuration parameter that defines an alternative namespace.
  This feature is useful if you want to share a namespace across multiple controllers.
  E.g. if you want a form to be processed by many controllers.
  E.g. if you want multiple pt_list lists to react on a single filter (e.g. string search)
+ (rk) CHG: added default XSS prevention to MVC views ***** IMPORTANT: this may result in unwanted effects for existing code, check and adapt your implemented calls of tx_ptmvc_view::addItem()! *****
  + tx_ptmvc_view::addItem(): added new optional param $filterHtml with default TRUE(!) and appropriate HTML filtering functionality
  + ext_emconf.php: raised pt_tools dependency to version "0.4.2-", raised pt_mvc version to "0.0.2dev"
+ (rk) ADD: DevDoc.txt: added this file
